# v3.0.0-beta.77

After more than a year, the app is finally out of beta and into the release candidate phase for `v3.0.0`.

A big thank you goes out to the community over in [discord](https://discord.gg/ZaEwHfDD5N) for providing such valuable feedback, feature requests, and even contributions that have helped shaped the project into what it is today.

Below is a summary of some of the most notable features since [Beta 29](https://github.com/orgs/playliga/discussions/350).

## Exhibition Mode

This mode allows users to jump right into the action without needing to start a new career.

Pick your team, your opponent's team, and select the starting side.

Further customization is planned in the future including picking the starters per team.

## Map Vetos

![veto](resources://markdown/whats-new/veto.png)

An oft-requested feature is the introduction of best-of series for certain matches.

The semi-finals and finals of the most esteemed tournaments will be best-of-3 and best-of-5 matches, respectively. In addition, a simulated map veto process was added to determine the map pool for the series.

## Custom Map Pools

> [!NOTE]
> This setting is not retroactive; thus, changes will not apply to matches that have already been scheduled.

A feature that has been frequently sought after is the ability to customize the map pool for each game. Not everybody is a fan of Vertigo or `de_cpl_fire` (for the CS 1.6 fans), so it is now possible to swap these out of the active map pool.

## Achievements

This feature should hopefully add some more satisfaction and guidance to your manager careers. To sweeten the deal, every achievement unlocked comes coupled with a cash reward.

Many thanks to **MattyRedemption** for providing a good starter set of achievements that should keep players busy until the next batch arrives.

## LAN Pings

![pings](resources://markdown/whats-new/pings.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> Only applicable to CS 1.6, CS:CZ, and CS:S.

A small quality-of-life change that should help with in-game immersion.

Elite competitions such as the league playoffs or the Electronic Sports World Cup will be considered LAN tournaments.

This is an in-game aesthetic change where player ping will be modified to simulate LAN latency, usually ranging from `3-5ms`.

## Sponsor Tournaments

![sponsors](resources://markdown/whats-new/sponsors.png)

As you rise through the competitive divisions, you'll unlock the ability to secure sponsorships that will bring in additional revenue for your team.

Furthermore, certain sponsors will hold yearly invitationals boasting significant prize pools.

## Competition Logos

![competitions](resources://markdown/whats-new/competitions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Thank you, **Ramos**, for providing these awesome competition logos!

Competition logos are a great addition that enhances the look-and-feel of the user interface by assigning a unique logo to each competition.

Additionally, each league division has a color hue incorporated into its logo that corresponds to its prestige.

For example, the Open division, being the lowest, has a humble bronze color in its logo. In contrast, a royal purple hue is used for the Premier division, befitting its stature as the highest division in the game.

## Player Avatars

![avatars](resources://markdown/whats-new/avatars.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Special shoutout to **DrRitzy** for creating the initial realism mod and **MattyRedemption** for further improving upon that foundation.

Although the app doesn't directly incorporate player avatars, this particular feature broadens the scope of customization for modders; allowing for improved realism and immersion when constructing database mods.

If you are interested in making your own database mod, check out the [Modding wiki](https://github.com/playliga/prototype/wiki/Modding)!

## Discord Server

![discord](resources://markdown/whats-new/discord.png)

There is now a discord server!

The server aims to keep everyone informed about the latest developments and serve as a hub for streamlined feedback. You'll be able to share suggestions, report bugs, and stay up-to-date with the project, all in one place.
